# Master's Project
--------------------
This repository contains the files of my master's research project in computational intelligence. 

The project is a research on the synchronization analysis of biological neuron models. The ideia is to analyze the possibility of trajectories segmentation by synchronizing a group of neurons with strong coupling force between each one and the dessynchronization of those by a weak coupling force. Finally, a proof of concept is created as a machine learning model of semi-supervised learning, thus representing samples with the same classification by a cluster of synchronized neurons, and the samples with different labels are dessynchronized.
